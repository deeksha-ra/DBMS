CricketBoard(BoardID, Name, Address, Contact_No,  TeamID, TName,	Coach,	Captain, PlayerID, PFName, PLName, Age, PDateofBirth, PlayingRole, email, contact_no, Batting, Bowling, MatchID, Match_Date, Time1, Result, GroundID, GName, Location, Capacity, UmpireID, UFName, ULName, UAge, UDateofBirth, Country, Uemail, Ucontact_no).

Functional Dependency:

BoardID → Name, Address, Contact_No
TeamID → TName, Coach, Captain
PlayerID → PFName, PLName, Age, PDateofBirth, PlayingRole, email, contact_no, Batting, Bowling
MatchID → Match_Date, Time1, Result, GroundID
GroundID → GName, Location, Capacity
UmpireID → UFName, ULName, UAge, UDateofBirth, Country, Uemail, Ucontact_no

create simplified tables:
CricketBoard (BoardID [PK], Name, Address, Contact_No)
CricketTeam (TeamID [PK], TName, Coach, Captain)
CricketPlayer (PlayerID [PK], TeamID [FK], PFName, PLName, Age, PDateofBirth, PlayingRole, email, contact_no, Batting, Bowling)
CricketMatch (MatchID [PK], TeamID [FK], Match_Date, Time1, Result, GroundID [FK])
CricketGround (GroundID [PK], GName, Location, Capacity)
CricketUmpire (UmpireID [PK], UFName, ULName, UAge, UDateofBirth, Country, Uemail, Ucontact_no)

First Normal Form:
Based on the provided relation, it appears that each attribute already contains atomic values, so there are no repeating groups to eliminate.

Second Normal Form:
The relation must already be in 1NF (First Normal Form).
All non-prime attributes (attributes not part of any candidate key) must be fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key.

It appears that the potential candidate keys could be:
1.	BoardID
2.	TeamID
3.	PlayerID
4.	MatchID
5.	UmpireID

we need to check if all non-prime attributes are fully functionally dependent on their respective candidate key(s).

Third Normal Form:
To determine whether the given relation is in the Third Normal Form (3NF), need to check two conditions:
1.	The relation must already be in the Second Normal Form (2NF).
2.	There should be no transitive dependencies between non-prime attributes and candidate keys.

BoardID → Name, Address, Contact_No
There are no transitive dependencies in this case, as Name, Address, and Contact_No are directly dependent on BoardID.

TeamID → TName, Coach, Captain
There are no transitive dependencies here either, as TName, Coach, and Captain are directly dependent on TeamID.

PlayerID → PFName, PLName, Age, PDateofBirth, PlayingRole, email, contact_no, Batting, Bowling
There are no transitive dependencies for PlayerID, as all the mentioned attributes are directly dependent on PlayerID.

MatchID → Match_Date, Time1, Result, GroundID
There is a transitive dependency between MatchID and GroundID through the Result attribute. To resolve this, we create a new table called MatchVenue:
MatchVenue (MatchID [PK], GroundID [FK])

GroundID → GName, Location, Capacity
There are no transitive dependencies for GroundID, as GName, Location, and Capacity are directly dependent on GroundID.

UmpireID → UFName, ULName, UAge, UDateofBirth, Country, Uemail, Ucontact_no
There are no transitive dependencies for UmpireID, as UFName, ULName, UAge, UDateofBirth, Country, Uemail, and Ucontact_no are directly dependent on UmpireID.

With the introduction of the MatchVenue table to resolve the transitive dependency, the relation now satisfies the conditions of the Third Normal Form (3NF).
